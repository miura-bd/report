# [NEW LAUNCH!] Detecting vulnerabilities in AWS Lambda functions using Amazon Inspector

## description

Developers are moving toward serverless compute, like AWS Lambda, for reduced infrastructure management, more efficient scaling, and reduced costs, but serverless workloads must be monitored for vulnerabilities in application code. In this session, learn how you can now use Amazon Inspector to detect vulnerabilities in your AWS Lambda functions in addition to software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure in Amazon EC2 and container-based workloads. Learn now Amazon Inspector automatically discovers and inventories all existing and newly created Lambda functions for scanning and continually monitors to automatically detect issues. Inspector gives you a single view of your workload vulnerabilities and helps you prioritize remediation through its highly contextualized severity scoring.
